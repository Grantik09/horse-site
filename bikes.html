        Wild Rydes has a dedicated staff that recruits, trains, and tends to our
        herd of bikes. We take great pride in the quality of bikes and rydes
        that we provide to our customers, and our staff exercises the utmost
        care in vetting the bikes that join our herd.
      </p>

      <p class="content">
        Every bike goes through a rigorous due diligence process where we
        perform background checks, flying exams, and several rounds of
        interviews. Bikes accepted to Wild Rydes are then treated to the best
        care and maintenance possible. We provide them excellent benefits,
        health care, and employee perks. This is part of our company philosophy
        in which happy bikes lead to happy customers.

              Indian Scout Bobber rolled into Wild Rydes in the summer of 2018
              and instantly became a fan favorite. With her low-slung stance and
              raw attitude, she brings an old-school cool to every ride. She’s
              known for spontaneous road trips, vintage leather jackets, and
              always having the best playlist blasting through her Bluetooth
              exhaust.
